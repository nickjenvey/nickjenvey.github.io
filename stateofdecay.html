    <h1>State of Decay 3</h1>
    <p>Working at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.sprungstudios.com/" target="_blank">Sprung Studios</a>, I was honoured to contribute as a UX Designer to State of Decay 3, the latest installment in Microsoft's <a class="inline-link" href="https://undeadlabs.com/" target="_blank">Undead Labs'</a> acclaimed action-adventure game series. With the main objective of raising this sequel to a serious first-party gaming series, our task was to build a UI that not only refined the user experience but also perfectly fit the game's post-apocalyptic location and atmosphere.</p>
    <p>For confidentiality reasons, I can't show visuals or go into deep details about the project. But I'm happy to discuss the main processes and highlights from my time on the game.</p>

    <h2>The challenges</h2>
    <p>Turning the concepts into a playable design for a large game like State of Decay 3 was a challenging task. We faced several challenges due to its complex gameplay, unique atmosphere, and our dedication to making it accessible for everybody.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex game mechanics: The game features everything from a detailed inventory management system to a flexible weapon modification process. Creating a user-friendly experience that covered all these elements was essential.</li>
      <li>Balancing game feel & usability: In a post-apocalyptic game, immersion is essential. However, we didn't want players to get lost. Our UX and UI was designed to enhance the story's intensity without becoming a barrier.</li>
      <li>Focus on accessibility: We're committed to inclusivity in gaming. Every design decision made was checked for how accessible it was, to ensure that everyone could enjoy the game.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Design objectives</h2>
    <p>We wanted to make a game that stands out not just for its gripping story, but also for its innovative user experience. Our focus was on clear, immersive gameplay, where the user interface felt like a natural part of the game world, especially in a game about survival and strategy. We didn't just meet inclusivity standards; we aimed to set new ones. And, because each player is unique, we designed the game to effortlessly adapt to different strategies and play styles.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration & progress</h2>
    <p>A significant emphasis on teamwork was central to the project. We ensured that our design decisions were firmly aligned with the game's concept and mechanics by collaborating with  game designers and developers. This commitment to collaboration and continuous improvement pushed us past obstacles and sparked new ideas.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding players: We worked hard to understand the gamers' preferences and problems. We obtained crucial insights into players' preferences and issues by soliciting input from the State of Decay 2 fan community. With this knowledge, we designed gaming interfaces and technologies that substantially improved the user experience.</li>
      <li>Regular feedback: Our weekly meetings weren't just routine updates. They evolved into creative hotspots, where ideas were refined, extended, and frequently pushed to surpass our own expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibly designed</h2>
    <p>The commitment to accessibility was paramount. By diving deep into Microsoft's comprehensive accessibility guidelines, we not only adhered to industry norms but also worked to push the envelope, providing an inclusive gaming experience. Every aspect was evaluated, from the subtitle design to the contextual interactions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adaptive control schemes: Recognizing the diverse needs of our player base, we implemented adaptive control schemes to ensure players could engage with the game in ways that were most comfortable to them.</li>
      <li>Visual & auditory aids: We focused on improving contrast in critical HUD components and providing spatial audio cues to aid gamers with visual or hearing impairments.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Conclusion: The Promise of State of Decay 3</h2>
    <p>Working on State of Decay 3 was about more than just developing a game. We intend to raise the bar in the industry. I was honoured to be a part of a project that was not only fun, but also pushing towards a more inclusive gaming world, thanks to fantastic cooperation, continual advancements, and a strong focus on inclusiveness. For me, UX design is about more than simply making things easier—it's about empowering users. As we await the game's release, I'm curious to see what kind of legacy it will leave.</p>
