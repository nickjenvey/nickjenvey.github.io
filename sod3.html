    <h1>State of Decay 3</h1>
    <p>Working at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.sprungstudios.com/" target="_blank">Sprung Studios</a>, I was honored to contribute as a UX Designer for State of Decay 3, the latest installment in the renowned action-adventure game series produced by Microsoft's <a class="inline-link" href="https://undeadlabs.com/" target="_blank">Undead Labs</a>. With the overarching goal of elevating this sequel into a flagship first-party franchise, our challenge was to not only refine the user experience but to create a UI that seamlessly complemented the game's evocative setting and atmosphere.</p>
    <p>For confidentiality reasons, I can't show visuals or go into deep details about the project. But I'm happy to discuss the main processes and highlights from my time on the game.</p>

    <h2>The challenges</h2>
    <p>Turning the concepts into a playable design for a big game like State of Decay 3 was a challenging task. We faced several challenges due to its complex gameplay, unique atmosphere, and our dedication to making it accessible for everyone.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex game mechanics: The game features everything from a detailed inventory management system to a flexible weapon modification process. Creating a user-friendly experience that covered all these elements was essential.</li>
      <li>Balancing game feel & usability: Immersion is key in a post-apocalyptic game. However, we didn't want players to get lost. Our UX & UI was designed to enhance the story's intensity without becoming a barrier.</li>
      <li>Focus on accessibility: We're committed to inclusivity in gaming. Every design decision made was checked for how accessible it was, ensuring that everyone could enjoy the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design objectives</h2>
    <p>We aimed to create a game that stands out not just for its gripping story, but also for its innovative user experience. Our focus was on clear, immersive gameplay, where the user interface feels like a natural part of the game world, especially in a game about survival and strategy. We didn't just meet inclusivity standards; we aimed to set new ones. And knowing that every player is unique, we designed the game to adapt smoothly to different strategies and play styles.</p>

    <h2>Collaboration & progress</h2>
    <p>Central to the project was a strong focus on collaboration. By partnering with Undead Labs' game designers and developers, we ensured our design choices were deeply aligned with the game's vision and mechanics. This dedication to teamwork and constant refinement pushed us past challenges and ignited fresh innovations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding players: We put in the effort to deeply grasp the players' preferences and challenges. By tapping into feedback from the State of Decay 2 fan base, we gained invaluable insights into players' preferences and challenges. With this insight, we crafted game interfaces and systems that significantly enriched the experience.</li>
      <li>Regular feedback: Our weekly meetings weren't just routine updates. They became hotspots of creativity, where ideas were honed, expanded, and frequently challenged to exceed our own expectations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibly designed</h2>
    <p>The commitment to accessibility was paramount. By diving deep into Microsoft's comprehensive accessibility guidelines, we not only adhered to industry standards but sought to push boundaries, ensuring an inclusive gaming experience. Every element, from subtitle design to contextual interactions, was scrutinized:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adaptive control schemes: Recognizing the diverse needs of our player base, we implemented adaptive control schemes, ensuring players could interact with the game in ways most comfortable to them.</li>
      <li>Visual & auditory aids: To cater to players with visual or auditory impairments, we worked on enhancing contrast in crucial HUD elements and provided spatial audio cues to guide players.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Promise of State of Decay 3</h2>
    <p>Working on State of Decay 3 has been about more than just making a game. We're aiming to set new standards in the industry. Thanks to great teamwork, ongoing improvements, and a strong focus on inclusivity, I was proud to be part of a project that's not just entertaining, but is also pushing for a more inclusive gaming world. For me, UX design isn't just about making things simpleâ€”it's about empowering users. As we look forward to the game's release, I'm excited about the lasting mark it might leave.</p>
