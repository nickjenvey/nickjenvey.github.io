    <h1>B2B Platform</h1>
    <p>The client is a game developer who creates a range of games that allow players to earn real-world experiences as they play. The client was seeking to build a tool to support their â€˜experienceâ€™ partners and also to streamline the workflow of their in-house teams.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>The process for partners to build out their experiential offerings was a highly manual process. There was no centralized medium to review performance or to explore and manage experiences. Event planning was not optimal and was something that was also being manually communicated. The proposed application portal would need to encompass:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Application economy and trends</li>
      <li>An experience catalog including different offerings</li>
      <li>A dashboard</li>
      <li>Events and announcements management tool</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding the needs of the user</h2>
    <p><strong>Provide a single tool from which they can manage and complete all tasks.</strong> The in-house team is continually bouncing between different applications within their workflow to complete tasks.</p>
    <p><strong>Offer distinct categories so partners can more deliberately explore offered experiences.</strong> Partners want to explore specific experiences and see what will work best for their own application.</p>
    <p><strong>Present information in a clear and accessible way.</strong> Specific users need clear and simple access to economic insights.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Mapping the users journey</h2>
    <p>Understanding the goals and pain points of a number of different user types who would be engaging with the portal allowed us to more insightfully map out each of their possible journeys through the app. We created a number of different flows to visualize these journeys and further identify how we can best optimize a frictionless experience for each of the application users.</p>

    <h2>Key design decisions</h2>
    <p><strong>Business insights for key users which inform the content of the page.</strong></p>
    <p>A business insight chart was designed into the masthead. This design structure was applied to all pages which had pertinent business metrics which needed to be drawn out and highlighted from the content of the page to follow.</p>
    <p><strong>A simple calendar to highlight application specific events.</strong></p>
    <p>Initial discussions with the client drew out their reluctance to include a calendar within the platform. However after presenting some other possible (less thorough options) the case for the calendar only became stronger. A calendar allows the experience to capture a much wider use case and after some back and forth with some direct users we landed on a simple layout with only key functionality required.</p>

    <h2>Designs</h2>
    <p>Delivering an experience and feel that was consistent with other B2B web apps in the clientâ€™s suite was something that was core for this project.</p>
    <p>BI charts became a consistent feature in the mastheads as it visually provided a relevant , time based summary of the more specific metric highlighted lower on the page. Chart manipulation was incorporated to allow different views and statistics within the charts provided. </p>
    <p>Animated transitions were a common feature used throughout the portal to provide instant feedback to users of their actions and decisions.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>The final solution was the design and delivery of a B2B partner portal which would add to their existing suite of web applications.</p>
    <p>We created a solution which covered the range of tasks a partner exploring the portal would want to complete. The portal also catered to the select personnel who would manage content and specifically support key functions and offerings within the application. Additionally, the varied level of access and permissions were considered in our design decisions and our final handover.</p>
