    <h1>Coast Capital Savings</h1>
    <p>During my time as a Digital UX Specialist at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com/" target="_blank">Coast Capital Savings</a>, I took on the pivotal role of designing a new corporate digital banking platform. This initiative wasn't just about refining the user experience (UX). The challenge was integrating the design seamlessly with Coast Capital Savings' existing brand and guidelines.</p>

    <h2>Design objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary objective was to create a platform attuned to the unique demands of corporate banking, while ensuring it faithfully represented Coast Capital Savings' brand essence. This platform had to be versatile, scaling smoothly across a spectrum of devices, from desktops to wearables.</p>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Collaborative approach</h2>
    <p>While I was at the helm of the design presentation, my efforts were complemented by various cross-functional teams. Product managers provided insights into functionality; developers shared technical feasibility; marketing experts provided perspectives on user acquisition, and brand strategists ensured alignment with corporate guidelines. My role was pivotal in synthesizing these insights and securing sign-offs by presenting compelling design narratives that catered to every stakeholder's perspective.</p>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Infusing user insights</h2>
    <p>Actively participating in user research studies and usability testings offered me profound insights. This direct engagement with users facilitated an understanding of their needs, preferences, and pain points. These findings were then integrated into the design, ensuring our solutions were genuinely user-centric.</p>

    <h2>Ensuring brand consistency</h2>
    <p>To guarantee the platformâ€™s design aligned with Coast Capital Savingsâ€™ brand, I actively established and advocated for design guidelines. These standards made certain the platform maintained consistency across various channels, fortifying brand recognition.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>While the platform is yet to be launched, the preliminary feedback from internal stakeholders and select user groups has been overwhelmingly positive. The anticipation is tangible, and there's a shared optimism about the transformative impact it will have on Coast Capital Savings' digital banking landscape.</p>
