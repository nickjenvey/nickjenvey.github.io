    <h1>Coast Capital Savings</h1>
    <p>At <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com/" target="_blank">Coast Capital Savings</a>, my role as a Digital UX Specialist involved spearheading the design of a corporate digital banking platform. More than just enhancing the user experience, my aim was to craft a platform that naturally fit with the bank's distinct brand, its established guidelines, and its integrated suite of services.</p>

    <h2>Design objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary objective was to create a platform attuned to the unique demands of corporate banking, while ensuring it faithfully represented Coast Capital Savings' brand essence. This platform had to be flexible and capable of handling the vast amount of financial data used by corporations. Key UX features included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Versatility: The digital landscape is vast. Our platform was designed to be flexible and compatible across a wide array of devices, ensuring a seamless experience from desktops to smart wearables.</li>
      <li>Top-notch security: Banking demands trust. We integrated advanced features like multi-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption. The challenge? Doing so without hindering the user's journey.</li>
      <li>Clear display: Financial details need clarity. Whether it's transaction histories or other vital banking information, our design prioritized clarity and ease of understanding.</li>
      <li>Feedback mechanisms: Banking actions shouldnâ€™t leave users in doubt. We implemented instant notifications and confirmations to keep users in the loop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collaborative approach</h2>
    <p>While I was the design focal point, collaboration was crucial.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product managers offered a lens into what functionalities were paramount.</li>
      <li>Developers brought in the technical possibilities and limitations.</li>
      <li>Marketing experts shared insights on attracting and retaining users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My role was weaving these diverse insights into a cohesive design story that resonated with every stakeholder.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Infusing user insights</h2>
    <p>Participating hands-on in user research and usability testing sessions was enlightening. These engagements provided a window into users' genuine needs, desires, and challenges. This feedback was a cornerstone in refining the designs, making it truly user-oriented.</p>

    <h2>Ensuring brand consistency</h2>
    <p>The core of a brand is its identity. To safeguard this identity for the platform, I played a central role in the development of design rules and a corporate style guide. This made sure that no matter how users engaged with the bank â€“ on our platform or elsewhere â€“ they always had a consistent brand experience, boosting brand recognition.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Even though the platform's official launch is on the horizon, the preliminary feedback is already painting a positive picture. Stakeholders and select user groups are hopeful, indicating a bright future for the corporate digital banking platform.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The upcoming digital banking platform at Coast Capital Savings is a testament to harmonizing innovative UX design with brand integrity. This journey, from leading intricate design deliberations to immersing in user research, underlines my holistic approach: blending diverse team insights, centering user preferences, and ensuring the brand's digital evolution remains anchored to its core values.</p>
