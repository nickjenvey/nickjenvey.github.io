    <h1>Coast Capital Savings</h1>
    <p>As a Digital UX Specialist at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com/" target="_blank">Coast Capital Savings</a>, I was tasked with designing a corporate digital banking platform. My objective was to design a platform that complemented the bank's distinct identity, set guidelines, and integrated range of services.</p>

    <h2>Design objectives</h2>
    <p>The primary goal was to create a platform that was attuned to the unique needs of corporate banking while properly representing Coasts' brand identity. This platform had to be flexible and capable of dealing with the huge amounts of financial data that businesses use. Some of the main UX aspects were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Versatility: The digital world is wide. The platform was designed to be flexible and compatible with a wide variety of devices, offering a consistent experience from computers to smartphones.</li>
      <li>Top-tier Security: Banking needs trust. We included advanced features such as multi-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption. The challenge? Doing so without interfering with the user's journey.</li>
      <li>Clear display: Financial details need clarity. Whether it's transaction histories or other vital banking information, our design prioritized clarity and ease of understanding.</li>
      <li>Feedback mechanisms: Banking actions should never leave users in the dark. To keep users in the loop, we implemented instant notifications and confirmations.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Collaborative approach</h2>
    <p>Collaboration was at the heart of our project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Product managers provided insight into which features were most important.</li>
      <li>Developers brought in the technical possibilities and limitations.</li>
      <li>Marketing experts shared their knowledge on gaining and retaining customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My role was to weave these diverse ideas into a cohesive design story that spoke to each stakeholder.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Infusing user insights</h2>
    <p>Participating in user research and usability testing sessions firsthand was eye-opening. These interactions gave insight into users' true wants, needs, and challenges. This feedback was crucial in refining the designs and making them truly user-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Ensuring brand consistency</h2>
    <p>The identity of a brand is its heart. In order to safeguard the platform's identity, I was involved in the creation of design guidelines and a corporate style guide. This ensured that regardless of how users interacted with the bank – whether on our platform or elsewhere – they had a consistent brand experience, improving brand recognition.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Even while the platform's official launch is on the horizon, first feedback is promising. Stakeholders and chosen user groups are optimistic, signalling that the corporate digital banking platform has a promising future.</p>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The future digital banking platform demonstrates the most recent advances in modern banking. As banking becomes more digital, platforms that deliver a user-friendly experience while ensuring brand validity become increasingly important. This new platform will highlight the significance of striking a balance between creative UX design and brand integrity.</p>
