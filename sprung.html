    <h1>Sprung Studios</h1>
    <p>A design agency that specializes in improving the user experience and interfaces of video games. We have worked with major clients in the industry such as EA, Microsoft, Activision, and Amazon.</p>
    <p>All projects I have worked on at Sprung are currently under NDA. Although I cannot showcase visual materials or specific details, I have shared my general processes for the select projects below.</p>

    <h2>AAA action-adventure</h2>
    <p>For the third installment, the client wanted to transform their game into a first party franchise. We focused on refining the user experience and creating UI to match the evolution of the game's atmosphere and setting.</p>
    <p>Working in a small team, I was responsible for designing the user experience of all the major features across the game. My role for the project comprised of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with the client’s in-house user research team to develop player personas.</li>
      <li>Designing user flows and user stories to better understand how players would interact with the features</li>
      <li>Creating and iterating on wireframes for all major features</li>
      <li>Producing in-depth UX prototypes for testing and development</li>
      <li>Presenting ideas and work to the client weekly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our team was also responsible for the creation of the UI assets and design systems in Figma. These are being utilized by the client’s project development team for rapid in-engine prototyping.</p>
    <p>I created and presented wireflows weekly to the client; while collecting and actioning on all feedback. Due to our team being external, documentation packages were created to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the game development cycles. These packages included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation explaining all design rationale</li>
      <li>Flows describing intended behaviour of each feature</li>
      <li>Organized asset component sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Casino game storefront</h2>
    <p>Allowing their players to turn in-game currency into real-life rewards, this client wanted to create a new redemption experience for their customers and revitalize their in-game storefronts.</p>
    <p>Alongside another UX/UI designer; we were responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with the client's user research to establish pain points and improve the overall user experience</li>
      <li>Creating and iterating on wireframes</li>
      <li>Creating the UI elements</li>
      <li>Establishing a design system to be used across all of their games</li>
      <li>Presenting all design materials to key stakeholders and business partners</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because the storefront spans across different games with their own individual style, creating a design system was crucial. Making sure to stay within conventions that could be replicated across all the games was top priority. We wanted players to find it easy to familiarize themselves with the new in-game storefront.</p>
    <p>We were very intentional in working closely with the client in order to retain focus on their key business goals and drivers. Being the top revenue stream for the company, the storefront is the most important piece and most engaged-with feature within their games.</p>
    <p>Although the main goal of this redesign was to be functional with a focus on usability, I wanted to incorporate moments of joy to make the redemption process more fun and engaging. I was able to achieve this through the addition of a purchase celebration at the end of a transaction.</p>

    <h2>Visual novel software</h2>
    <p>This project sought to turn a programmer-based software into an extremely easy and user-friendly platform for anyone to create visual novels. Our team was tasked with designing the entire user experience of the platform. Functions of the platform included asset creation and management, writing, and branching paths.</p>
    <p>My role within the project included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Researching the users of the client's current software as well as competitors within the market.</li>
      <li>Translating and identifying pain points within the current software</li>
      <li>Creating user task flows, user stories, and sitemaps of the systems</li>
      <li>Wireframing the platform's new features and systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Making asset creation and management easy for users who are new to the software was a particular challenge. This feature also needed to be efficient for existing users who were used to writing code to create their visual novels. Creating user flows for this feature led to the project being re-scoped by the client. We were able to help them better understand:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How new users would use assets within their visual novels</li>
      <li>Why existing users preferred using code and how the new management system would work for them</li>
      <li>Assets needed specific rules, roles, and ways to be incorporated into a project based on these two user types</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We worked closely with the client to ensure all designs were buildable, within scope, and captured what they envisioned their platform to be.</p>
