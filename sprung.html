    <h1>Sprung Studios</h1>
    <p>As a UX designer at Sprung Studios, a design agency specializing in improving the user experience and interfaces of video games, I have had the opportunity to work with major clients in the industry such as EA, Microsoft, Activision, and Amazon.</p>
    <p>Please note that due to confidentiality agreements, I am unable to showcase visual materials or provide specific details for the projects I worked on at Sprung. However, I can share the general processes and key aspects of select projects as outlined below.</p>

    <h2>AAA action-adventure</h2>
    <p>For the third installment of a popular action-adventure game, our goal was to transform it into a first-party franchise. My role within a small team was to refine the user experience and create UI elements that aligned with the game's evolving atmosphere and setting.</p>
    <p>Key responsibilities for this project included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborating with the client's in-house user research team to develop player personas</li>
      <li>Designing user flows and user stories to gain insights into how players would interact with the game's features</li>
      <li>Creating and iterating on wireframes for all major features</li>
      <li>Producing detailed UX prototypes for testing and development</li>
      <li>Presenting ideas and work to the client on a weekly basis</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, our team was responsible for creating UI assets and design systems in Figma, which were utilized by the client's project development team for rapid in-engine prototyping.</p>

    <h2>Casino game storefront</h2>
    <p>In this project, we aimed to create a new redemption experience for players to turn in-game currency into real-life rewards and revitalize the in-game storefronts of our client's casino games.</p>
    <p>Working alongside another UX/UI designer, my responsibilities included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborating with the client's user research team to identify pain points and improve the overall user experience</li>
      <li>Creating and iterating on wireframes</li>
      <li>Designing UI elements</li>
      <li>Establishing a design system to be used across all of their games</li>
      <li>Presenting design materials to key stakeholders and business partners</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given that the storefront spanned across different games with individual styles, establishing a design system was crucial. We aimed to ensure familiarity for players while maintaining consistency across the games. The storefront was the most important and engaged-with feature within the games, serving as the top revenue stream for the company.</p>
    <p>While the primary focus of the redesign was functionality and usability, I also incorporated moments of joy to make the redemption process more fun and engaging. This was achieved through the addition of a purchase celebration at the end of a transaction.</p>

    <h2>Visual novel software</h2>
    <p>Our team was tasked with turning a programmer-based software into an easy and user-friendly platform for anyone to create visual novels. This involved designing the entire user experience, including asset creation and management, writing, and branching paths.</p>
    <p>My specific contributions to the project included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducting user research on the current software's users and analyzing competitors in the market</li>
      <li>Identifying pain points and translating them into improved user task flows, user stories, and sitemaps</li>
      <li>Wireframing the platform's new features and systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of the notable challenges was making asset creation and management easy for new users while maintaining efficiency for existing users accustomed to writing code for their visual novels. To address this, we created user flows that led to the project being re-scoped, helping the client understand how different user types would interact with assets and the benefits of the new management system.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, close collaboration with the client ensured that all designs were buildable, within scope, and aligned with their vision for the platform.</p>
