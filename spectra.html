    <h1>Spectra Wines</h1>
    <p>Commerce7, a new e-commerce platform within the alcohol industry, wanted to create the first ever platform theme and demonstration project.</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Being the very first theme for the platform, the design needed to be simple enough for a first time user while also being intriguing, visually engaging and showcase all of the platform's ecommerce technology and features.</p>

    <h2>Wireframing process</h2>
    <p>There are a couple reasons why I like to quickly sketch and annotate what I'm thinking the design should look like. Firstly, I'm less likely to get stuck on something, being able to sketch multiple things out in the matter of minutes. Even fleeting ideas won't be forgotten, serving as good reference later. Secondly, I think sketching encourages more creativity, because it doesn't allow for time to get bogged down by details. I quickly sketched a few different layouts to get a sense of what it could look like and make sure that all the necessary features were there.</p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was aiming to create a theme that represented the new-age winery experience; clean, modern yet rustic, and homely. The colour palette was inspired by the imagery of sunsets by the vineyard, specifically with hues of purples, oranges, and yellows. Of interest, the brand logo, wine bottle designs, and name were completely designed and created by me.</p>
