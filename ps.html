    <h1>B2B Platform</h1>
    <p>I collaborated with a game developer client who specializes in creating games that offer players real-world experiences. They needed assistance in building a tool to support their "experience" partners and streamline their in-house teams' workflows.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>The process for partners to develop their experiential offerings was cumbersome and manual. There was a lack of a centralized medium for reviewing performance, managing experiences, and communicating event planning. To address these challenges, our proposed solution was an application portal that encompassed the following key features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Application economy and trends</li>
      <li>A comprehensive experience catalog with diverse offerings</li>
      <li>An intuitive dashboard for managing tasks</li>
      <li>Events and announcements management tool</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding the users' needs</h2>
    <p>Our goal was to provide a single, efficient tool that would streamline tasks for both experience partners and the in-house team. We aimed to offer distinct categories, enabling partners to explore different experiences deliberately and find the ones best suited for their applications. Furthermore, we focused on presenting information in a clear and accessible manner, ensuring that users could easily access economic insights relevant to their specific needs.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Mapping the users' journey</h2>
    <p>By thoroughly understanding the goals and pain points of various user types who would engage with the portal, we were able to map out their individual journeys within the app. Through visualizing these journeys, we gained valuable insights into optimizing a frictionless experience for each user group.</p>

    <h2>Key design decisions</h2>
    <p>To highlight pertinent business metrics, we designed a business insight chart integrated into the masthead. This design structure was implemented across all pages requiring the highlighting of relevant metrics. Despite initial reservations from the client, we advocated for the inclusion of a simple calendar, which proved essential for capturing a wide range of use cases. Through ongoing collaboration and feedback from direct users, we developed a calendar layout that fulfilled the key functionality requirements.</p>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>Designs</h2>
    <p>We prioritized delivering a consistent experience aligned with the client's existing suite of B2B web apps. A key design element we implemented was the incorporation of BI charts into the mastheads, offering visually compelling, time-based summaries of specific metrics on each page. Chart manipulation capabilities were also included to allow for various views and statistics within the charts. Furthermore, we utilized animated transitions throughout the portal to provide users with instant feedback on their actions and decisions.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>Our final solution was the design and delivery of a B2B partner portal, seamlessly integrated into the client's suite of web applications. The portal effectively addressed the diverse range of tasks that partners needed to complete, while also providing content management and supporting key functions and offerings within the application. We carefully considered the varying levels of access and permissions in our design decisions, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly solution.</p>
    <p>By collaborating closely with the client and understanding the needs of their users, we successfully delivered a partner portal that significantly improved workflow efficiency and user experience.
