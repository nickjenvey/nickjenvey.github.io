    <h1>PlayStudios</h1>
    <p>While at <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.sprungstudios.com/" target="_blank">Sprung Studios</a>, I worked with <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.playstudios.com/" target="_blank">PlayStudios</a>, a company famed for its games that combine digital that offer real-world experiences. Our joint mission was to create a tool that would better support their partners and make their internal team's processes more efficient.</p>

    <h2>Problem definition</h2>
    <p>Partners found the process of creating their experiential offerings to be tedious and heavily manual. There wasn't a unified platform for tracking performance, managing experiences, or coordinating event plans. Our solution to these issues? An application portal fortified with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Insights into application economy and trends.</li>
      <li>A broad catalog of experiences.</li>
      <li>A user-friendly dashboard for task management.</li>
      <li>Tools for overseeing events and announcements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User-centric approach</h2>
    <p>We aimed to devise a singular, potent tool that simplified operations for both partners and PlayStudios' internal team. It was essential to categorize offerings clearly, allowing partners to efficiently navigate and select the best fit. Clear and easily accessible data, especially economic insights tailored to user needs, was a priority.</p>

  <section class="work-section">
    <h2>User journey mapping</h2>
    <p>By diving deep into the aspirations and hurdles of potential portal users, we plotted their unique in-app pathways. Visualizing these pathways was instrumental in carving out a seamless app experience for every user type.</p>

    <h2>Design choices</h2>
    <p>Our designs spotlighted vital business metrics through a business insight chart embedded in the masthead, a feature consistent across all metric-centric pages. This strategic placement ensured that these vital figures were immediately visible and accessible to users, thereby enhancing their experience and understanding of the data. We stood by our decision to introduce a user-friendly calendar despite some initial client hesitations. This addition, honed by continuous feedback, tackled diverse user needs adeptly.</p>

    <h2>Design highlights</h2>
    <p>We enriched the user experience with business insight charts in the mastheads, offering dynamic, timely metric summaries. Users could manipulate these charts, revealing various perspectives and data points. Engaging animated transitions throughout the portal ensured users were always clued into the outcomes of their interactions.</p>

    <h2>Our offering</h2>
    <p>The culmination of our efforts was a B2B partner portal that integrated perfectly with PlayStudios' suite of web applications. This portal not only streamlined tasks for partners but also excelled in content management and essential app functions. We diligently factored in different user access levels, guaranteeing an inclusive and intuitive solution.</p>
    <p>In tandem with PlayStudios and by putting user needs at the forefront, we crafted a portal that has since revolutionized workflow and user satisfaction.</p>
